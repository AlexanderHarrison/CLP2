<title>Integration</title>
<introduction>

<p>
Calculus is built on two operations <mdash/> differentiation and integration.
<ul>
<li> Differentiation <mdash/> as we saw last term, differentiation allows us to compute and
study the instantaneous rate of change of quantities. At its most basic it
allows us to compute tangent lines and velocities, but it also led us to quite
sophisticated applications including approximation of functions
through Taylor polynomials and optimisation of quantities by studying critical
and singular points.
</li>
<li> Integration <mdash/> at its most basic, allows us to analyse the area under a
curve. Of course, its application and importance extend far beyond areas and it plays a
central role in solving differential equations.
</li>
</ul>

It is not immediately obvious that these two topics are related to each other.  However, as we shall see, they are indeed intimately linked.
