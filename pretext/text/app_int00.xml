<title>Applications of Integration</title>
<introduction>

<p>
In the previous chapter we defined the definite integral, based on its interpretation as  the area of a region in the <m>xy</m>-plane. We also developed a bunch of theory to help us  work with integrals. This abstract definition, and the associated theory,  turns out to be  extremely useful simply because "areas of regions in the <m>xy</m>-plane" appear in a huge  number of different settings, many of which seem superficially not to involve "areas of   regions in the <m>xy</m>-plane". Here are some examples.
<ul>
<li>
	The work involved in moving a particle or in pumping a fluid out of a reservoir. See  section<nbsp/><xref ref="sec_work"/>.
</li>
<li>
	The average value of a function. See section<nbsp/><xref ref="sec_avg"/>.
</li>
<li>
	The center of mass of an object. See section<nbsp/><xref ref="sec_com"/>.
</li>
<li>
	The time dependence of temperature. See section<nbsp/><xref ref="sec_sep_de"/>.
</li>
<li>
	Radiocarbon dating. See section<nbsp/><xref ref="sec_sep_de"/>.
</li>
</ul>
Let us start with the first of these examples.
